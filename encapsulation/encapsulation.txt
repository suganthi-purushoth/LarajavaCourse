one of the pillers of Object oriented programming language.
encapsulation
inheritance
polymorpism
abstract class

ENCAPSULATION:
-------------
1.Encapsulation in java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit(one unit),for example,
				a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
-we can able to achive data security through encapsulation
-we can achive data hiding
-by using getters and setters we can make the data ready-only or write-only
-by using getters and setters we can have control over the data.
2.we can create a fully encapsulated class in java by making all the data members of the class private.
3.By providing only a setter or getter method,you can make the class read-only or write-only.In other words,
		you can skip the getter or setter methods.
4.It provides you the control over the data.suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only ,
		you can write the logic inside the setter method.
you can write the logic not to store the negative members in the setter methods.
5.It is a way to achive data hiding in java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.



//write only=you can change the data
//read only=you cannot change the data
//static variable or non static variable=data members(data)
//static methods or non static methods=member functions(code)
//we can to use getter and setter () use indirectly

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming(OOP) 
        and involves hiding internal data and implementation details of a class and providing access to them through methods. 
		It helps in achieving data abstraction and protects the data from unauthorized access.
