NON- STATIC
------------
non static members cannot be reference from a static context without a referance variable
//An object is a real world entity,
//class is a blue print to creae the objects
//objects will be having properties or datamembers or attributes and behaviours 

//Ex:Dog object properties or attributes:name,age,color,bread,gender,weiht
                     //Behaviours:bark(),chaseCat(),bite(),chaseVehicle()
//properties=data members
//behaviours=member functions
//for one class you can to create any no of object.
//G g1=G(class name),g1(reference variable name)(name can be anything)
//=assignment operator(left side assignment)
//new is a keyword and also an operator
//G()-calling G class no argument constructor.
//variable,method follow the class link variableNumberOne,methodNumberOne
//variable name should be valid identifier
//while you are refering to the class case must be same(as a standard we will write the class namein camel case like ThisIsTheCamelCase
//Objects are stored inside heap memory
//non-static members are loading to the memory while objects are created.
//all the non-static members are loading to the memory while we are creating objects to that particular class.it can be non-static method or it can be a non static block.

//10=int i; not possible
//non static method test is loading to the memory whenever we are creating an object to the H class.
//by using H class reference h1 we can access test method is non static

non static mem cannot be reference with out ref var
//ststic block also comes under static constant or static area
