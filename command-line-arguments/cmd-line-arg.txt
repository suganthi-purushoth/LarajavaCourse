//main() called by the jvm
//directly cannot passed by the value
//System=lang package
//string[] args ={};  show the memory location where the obj is available

//JVM will be calling the main method by supplying empty string array object 
          //if you dont supply anything as a command line argument while executing any class.
//if you directly print the array reference you will be getting the memory address of that array object.
//each and every array will be having a length.we can find out the array length by using 'length'properly(by calling length property on the array reference).
//arrays are also objects in java.
//array index will be starting from 0 but length we will calculate from no.1.
//if there are no elements are present in the array then we can say that array is empty or (size or length is 0).
//by default whatever value you are supplying as command line argument that will be considered as string type only.
//there is no method for converting from string to char 
//we cant able to convert from string to char
//but we can convert from char to string
